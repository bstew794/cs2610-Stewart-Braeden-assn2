This blog is finished, thank you for your patience.

To make sure that the populate scripts are working, 
remember to delete db.slte3 in the mysite folder before 
running "python manage.py migrate".

Additionally, The current time and date only updates
when the user manually refreshes the webpage; when 
I learn how to implement a clock function or something 
similar to setInterval() in javascript, then I will update it.
